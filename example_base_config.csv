Variable Name,Value,Min Value,Max Value,Step size,Type,Description,Class
ratio_user_advertiser,10,10,100,power of 10,variable,This variable defines the size of the user sample in comparison to the advertiser sample.,Simulation
advertiser_size,100,10,100,power of 10,variable,This variable defines the size of the advertiser. Larger sizes are possible but they slow the computation.,Simulation
ratio_advertisers,0.9,0.1,0.99,0.1,variable,This variable defines the ratio of retailers and economic opportunity advertisers. Varying it will change the degree of the discrimination observed. However it is present even for a low percentage of retailers.,Simulation
ratio_sex_users,0.5,0.1,0.9,0.1,variable,This variable defines the ratio of female and male users. Varying it changes the degree of discrimination observed. It can be used to simulate different platforms with different amount of female and male users.,Advertiser
budget,0.3,(1/100 * user_size)*max_bid,(10*usersize)*max_bid,power of 10,variable,"This variable defines the advertisers' budgets. If the total of all budgets is lower than the user size, all advertiser will sell out during the simulation and the platform revenue will be mostly constant, even for different auction mechanisms. On the other hand if the budgets are higher than the user size, the platfrom's revenue will change in dependence of the auction mechanism. However there is less posssibility for strategized bidding.",Advertiser
slots_per_user,10,-,-,-,constant,"This variable defines how many ad slots are available per user. Varying this value will make the auction more or less competitive, but I do not expect it to have any other important effect.",User
mu_click_through_rate,0.0317,-,-,-,constant,This mean is used to draw the user's effective click-through-rate from a gauss distribution limited between 0 and 1.  The value is based on empirical measurements. However the user's effective click-through-rate is not in usage yet.,User
sigma_click_through_rate,0.01,-,-,-,constant,This standard deviation is used to draw the user's effective click-through-rate from a gauss distribution limited between 0 and 1. The value is based on empirical measurements. However the user's effective click-through-rate is not in usage yet.,User
variance_estimated_value_per_click,0.7,-,-,-,constant,"This variance is used for the advertiser's estimation of a user's value-per-click, which is drawn from a log-normal distribution. The value is drawn from a research paper.",Advertiser
mu_estimated_value_per_click_retailer_male,-3.5,-,-,-,constant,"This mean is used for the retailer's estimation of a female user's value-per-click, which is drawn from a log-normal distribution. The value is drawn from a research paper.",Advertiser
mu_estimated_value_per_click_retailer_female,-2.4,-,-,-,constant,"This mean is used for the retailer's estimation of a male user's value-per-click, which is drawn from a log-normal distribution. The value is drawn from a research paper.",Advertiser
mu_estimated_value_per_click_economic,-2.8,-,-,-,constant,"This mean is used for the economic opportunity advertiser's estimation of a male user's value-per-click, which is drawn from a log-normal distribution. Natuarally the economic opportunity advertiser's mean should be between the retailer's female and male mean, otherwise retailer will tend to outbid economic opportunity advertisers in any category. The value is drawn from a research paper.",Advertiser
